### Experience 

It took me about two months to finish this course and all assignments. But I have to say that it's really a GOOOOD COURSE!!! I love Justin !!! His courses are always simple but profound. So after I finished the CNN part, I started to watch his new course EECS598 in Umich, where he introduced the comprehensive applications of different neural networks and the latest breakthrough in related fields.
